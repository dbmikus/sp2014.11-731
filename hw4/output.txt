nothing new : two judges attend the event society федералистов for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
however , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two law firms in this case , as well as the company with large financial interests , was enough signal to the activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign to raise money with lawyers and the things which are now viewed in court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to the critics who say they are very willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like the federalist society .

sister of mexico 's president , it is clear , lost to the elections in michoacan

раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be up to some extent protected , but it would not be immune . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help the wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and to civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , which will lead to опозданиям staff with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether a letter to panetta or the latest warning senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from reductions , will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops from the shell , but without a core .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - this is business as usual .
mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research project , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the extensive and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way , or " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with that woman miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .

i think we all feel some гранж alienated from the rest of the word .
at first , your music was more grim , and now it has become more positive .
it 's interesting , because , i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a bit more .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some sort of injury and you have lost family member or friend , these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music , and those two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

the first fear is the limitation of the border , where you can build .
" we need to think about the new urban planning tools , because the current [ with regard to the general capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to the real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already have a work made outside кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he was grateful for the possibility that his profession , city hall offers to join the project , " from the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which sets the name of this part of the complex , as the rules of the competition lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal , reading , to see and understand the region as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some , the gate could overlap on the programme and identifying with the project architect for the neighboring gate .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами low molecular weight , and other - so - called мальтенами , who , along a road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and the change during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperatures , " said an expert in chemical engineering .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных , in the bitumen , and then спрессованных .
a movement of the vehicles and latch efforts , it helps to be very well on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the latest layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body and it 's hard for her to go from there , and it causes размягчение all sections of the cover , and therefore education yam .

if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of the emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection on the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
this is why germany is one of them in its decision to abandon its nuclear energy .
on the other hand , the great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - so that 's just a few of those who strongly to their projects .
although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it receives a 30 % of its electricity , and she was also the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from low - cost electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and created a lot of jobs that may not be moved to another industry .

then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , he said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people who will determine our future , may 2011 , princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified , in dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and it is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates -- large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , was given exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to hold the vote and to make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
there is no , we are dreaming not of the blade the guillotine , but on the implementation of the " joint , the clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this socialist proposals and jacques delors now require all of the european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty .

analysis of the incidents , pointed to several calls were in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but of course , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before you talk about the operational cooperation between the aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by the washington now has put pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the boko haram , which creates problems .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas , she took responsibility for per share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in the джосе , and then for the one in abuja .
in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab in kenya , boko haram poses a new challenge to the continent .
weakened by crisis , america can lead a complex world with the help of the ordinary , or rather simplistic ideas ?
kane has a few days , mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and other множат loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party .
mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , migration is as much as their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the complex foreign policy could not overcome position that потакает emotions .
but huntsman , who has been at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney has also promised the military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , said that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .

after iraq , it does not believe in the military intervention , which confused in the sand .
nord stream , the new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe .

and the opportunity to build the pipeline on the same direction have already been discussed .
these two countries will lose part of its power : they will be more difficult to influence russia , threatening to shut down access to western european markets .
but at the cost of europe 's energy , because the project has created a gap between eastern and western europe .
" this pipeline is a part of the cooperation with russia , a new artery that connects us organically , " said francois fillon , opening the gas pipeline , showing the extent to which the large natural gas contracts are important politically and economically .

" in the event of an accident , we close the flow of gas , however , than a minute , " said jens mueller .
but this seems unlikely that piping designers seams , designed for протечку only once in 100,000 years .
сигароообразный аппарат introduced a 1 - meter diameter pipeline inside and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company in rent on the twenty - five years with the possibility of extension of the entire volume of gas .
gas pipeline construction financing was provided on 30 per cent of shareholders , and the 70 % of bank loans .
out of the baltic sea natural gas pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , засаженный coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas before , as he sucked in german gas pipelines .
at full capacity it will be 3 million in an hour , and 6 million in 2012 .
